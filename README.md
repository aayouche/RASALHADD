ncdump -h filename

This will give data and informations about each file such as the type of the eddy (cyclone or anticyclone) between 2000 and 2015 - the average radius, the average position and the lifetime. For some specific years (when the colocalization is successful), the colocalized ARGO profiles are given.
NB: some (or one) files may contains multiple years of detection such as the 2014 year
